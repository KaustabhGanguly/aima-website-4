Q. In Section 4.4.1 we introduced belief states to solve sensorless search problems. A sequence of actions solves a sensorless problem if it maps every physical state in the initial belief state <i>b</i> to a goal state. Suppose the agent knows h*(s), the true optimal cost of solving the physical state <i>s</i> in the fully observable problem, for every state <i>s</i> in <i>b</i>. Find an admissible heuristic <i>h(b)</i> for the sensorless problem in terms of these costs, and prove its admissibilty. Comment on the accuracy of this heuristic on the sensorless vacuum problem of : ![down](https://image.ibb.co/gvmzFn/Screen_Shot_2018_02_18_at_4_29_31_PM.png)How well does : $$A^âˆ—$$ perform?
